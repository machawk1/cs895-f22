# Labeled tweets of Donald Trump

## About this repository

This repository contains my forensic study on "Labeled tweets of Donald Trump"

Inspiration is drawn from [Himarsha's](https://twitter.com/HimarshaJ) and [Kritika's](https://twitter.com/kritika_garg) study on ["Replaying Archived Twitter: When your bird is broken, will it bring you down?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12092).

The [Files](Files) folder contains the codes and the outputs I used for my study and presentation. They are listed below,
  * [Dataset](Files/tweetids): Contains the tweet IDs I used gathered from the previous study.
  * [@realDonaldTrump's tweet dataset](Files/full_tweets): Contains the dataset I scraped from [Trump Twitter Archive](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.trumptwitterarchive.site/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1670529569148446&usg=AOvVaw2qZJnB3GCPgm61xBmpkThh)
  * [Charts](Files/charts): Contains the charts I created and used in the presentation.
  * [Old UI vd New UI](Files/oldvsnew): Contains the code used to categorize the mementos into the old and new UIs.
  * [CDX Search](Files/cdx_search): Contains the code used to perform a CDX search.
