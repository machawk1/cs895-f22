# How well are Sri Lankan websites archived?

## About this repository

This repository contains my forensic study on "How well are Sri Lankan websites archived?".

Inspiration is drawn from Dr. Alkwai's study on ["How Well Are Arabic Websites Archived?"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2756406.2756912).

The [Files](Files) folder contains the codes and the outputs I used for my study and presentation. They are listed below,
  * [Dataset](Files/dataset): Contains the Alexa top million sites, the filtered Sri Lankan sites and the nationsonline directory of Sri Lankan websites.
  * [Carbondate](Files/carbondate): Contains the code used to extract the carbondate and the output.
  * [Charts](Files/charts): Contains the charts I created and used in the presentation.
  * [Language Detection](Files/langdetect): Contains the code used to detect the language of the website, and the output.
  * [Live Web Status](Files/live_web): Contains the code used to detect the live web status of the particular website, and the results.
  * [MemGator](Files/memgator): Contains the code used to gather the results from running the websites through MemGator.
  * [URL Variations](Files/url_variations): Contains the output of the CDX prefix search as a csv file
