The paper analyzes the relationship between the lexical change diffusion (how the change in the meaning or use of a word is spread) and underlying socio-geographic factors. The proposed methodology combines a latent spacio-temporal variables in an auto regression identifying high level patterns of linguistic diffusion. Further, the study associates these high level patterns with geographic features and demographic composition of regions of interest.
