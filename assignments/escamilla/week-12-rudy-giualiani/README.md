# When a 'Blue Check' Means Nothing

## About this repository

This repository contains a forensic presenation given by Emily Escamilla on November 14, 2022. The presentation uses the verified account @RudyGiualianiESQ (an impersonation account) as a case study of impersonation accounts that have been verified and have a 'blue check' as a result of Elon Musk taking over Twitter.
