# Web Archival Survey of Global Data Portals
Quantitative data forms the bedrock with which we can measure the world around us. Data is used by everyone, everyday, especially in regards to national, global, health, environmental, and economic decisions. Data from portals, such as the World Health Organization and United Nations, are frequently cited by leaders of nations, field experts, in research papers, and in news articles. These data portals are often proprietary or have limited archivability, sometimes even having negative conseuences for archives. While some portals fair better than others, there is still a long way to go, both in regard to the collected data and their archivability on the web, to effectively utilize these vast troves of information to their full potential.
