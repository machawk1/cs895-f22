# Fake News vs Satire

This presentation discusses the WebSCi 2018 paper "Fake News vs Satire: A Dataset and Analysis" by Golbeck et al. [Link](https://web.stanford.edu/~mattm401/docs/2018-Golbeck-WebSci-FakeNewsVsSatire.pdf)
The paper supports fake news research with a dataset of fake news and satire stories.
These stories are hand coded, verified, and includes rebuttals for fake news.
It also includes a thematic content analysis of the articles, with promising fake/satire classification results from linguistic features.
