# Where Did the Web Archive Go?

This presentation discusses the TPDL 2021 paper "Where Did the Web Archive Go?" by Aturban et al. [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05939.pdf)
Its authors performed a longitudinal investigation of mementos in web archives, and analyzed changes to their content and URI-Ms.
They found that four web archives changed their base URIs and left no machine-readable method to locate their new base URIs, necessitating manual rediscovery.
From those archives, 537 of 1,981 mementos were impacted: 517 had a different Memento-Datetime header / HTTP status code / URI-R, and 20 mementos were not found at all.
This provides a cautionary tale for web archives that have to change domains or web archiving platforms.
